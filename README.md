# Data Science Projects - IBM Professional Certificate

This repository contains various projects I completed as part of the **IBM Professional Data Science Certificate**. The projects cover key areas in data science, including exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, machine learning model building, SQL querying, and web scraping. Below is an overview of the project, including the specific objectives and tasks performed throughout.

## Project Components

1. **Data_Wrangling.ipynb**  
   Focuses on **data wrangling**, including cleaning and transforming the raw data into a usable format. This step is crucial for ensuring that the data is ready for analysis and machine learning.

2. **Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb**  
   In this notebook, the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is performed. It involves using **Pandas** and **Matplotlib** to explore the dataset, visualize relationships between features, and identify trends and outliers.

3. **Machine_Learning_Prediction_Part.ipynb**  
   This notebook involves applying machine learning algorithms such as **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, **Classification Trees**, and **Logistic Regression**. The models are trained using the dataset, and hyperparameter tuning is done to find the best parameters for each model.

4. **SQL_queries.ipynb**  
   This notebook demonstrates the use of **SQL queries** for data manipulation and analysis. The dataset is loaded into a **DB2** database, and SQL queries are executed to perform specific data extraction tasks and answer relevant questions.

5. **Web_Scraping.ipynb**  
   Web scraping is performed using **BeautifulSoup** to extract **Falcon 9 launch records** from a **Wikipedia HTML table**. The table is parsed, and the data is converted into a **Pandas DataFrame** for further analysis.
